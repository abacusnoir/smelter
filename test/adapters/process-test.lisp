  (:documentation "
Comprehensive test suite for Smelter Process/Shell Adapter

Tests all major functionality including:
- Core command execution (run, shell)
- Input/output handling
- Piping and command chaining
- Environment variable operations
- Working directory management
- Utility functions (which, executable?, escaping)
- Error handling and edge cases
- Legacy API compatibility

The test suite is designed to be run in both REPL and script modes,
providing immediate feedback on adapter functionality.
