# ADT Pattern Matching Bootstrap Fix

**Date**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Implemented - Build-Time Bootstrapping Solution

## Problem Statement

The Smelter standalone binary had a critical issue where **all pattern matching on ADT types would fail** with "undefined function" errors, despite working perfectly in direct SBCL sessions. When users attempted to use `match` expressions on Result, Optional, or Tuple types, they would encounter errors like:

```
undefined function: coalton-library/classes:|result/ok-_0|
Error: unknown type specifier: coalton-library/classes::|tuple/tuple|
```

The specific failing command:
```bash
./smt eval '(match (Ok 1) ((Ok x) (+ x 1)) ((Err _) 0))'
```

This made pattern matching - a core functional programming feature - completely unusable in the final executable.

## Root Cause Analysis: The "Chicken-and-Egg" Problem

The issue stems from a **circular dependency in Coalton's pattern matching compilation**:

### How Coalton Pattern Matching Works

1. When Coalton compiles a `match` expression, it needs ADT accessor functions like `|result/ok-_0|` to extract values from pattern-matched objects
2. These accessor functions are **not pre-written in library files** - they are **generated on-demand** by the `match` macro itself
3. The first time you compile a `match` expression, the macro generates the required accessor functions and type predicates
4. Subsequent `match` expressions use the already-generated functions

### The Bootstrap Problem in Saved Binaries

In a standalone binary created with `sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die`:

1. **During Build**: Pattern matching works fine because we're in a live SBCL session where the macro can generate functions on-demand
2. **In Saved Binary**: The generated accessor functions **are not included** in the saved image
3. **At Runtime**: When a user runs a `match` expression, the macro tries to call accessor functions that **don't exist**
4. **Result**: "Undefined function" errors

### The IKEA Analogy

This is like IKEA packing a piece of furniture in a box:
- They include all the **pre-manufactured parts** (the ADT constructors like `Ok` and `Err` work fine)
- They include the **instruction manual** (the `match` macro compiles correctly)
- But they **forget to pack the Allen wrench** (the accessor functions needed for assembly)
- When the customer (user) tries to assemble it at home (runtime), they have everything except the essential tool needed for the final step

## The "Build-Time Bootstrapping" Solution

The definitive solution, validated by examining the working `coalton-playground` project, is **Build-Time Bootstrapping**. This approach forces the generation of all necessary runtime machinery during the image creation process, ensuring these components are saved into the final executable.

### Implementation Strategy

The fix involves adding a comprehensive bootstrapping code block to `build/create-image.lisp` that:

1. **Creates a Bootstrap Package**: A temporary `coalton-bootstrap` package with access to Coalton and the prelude.
2. **Forces Pattern Matching Compilation**: Defines dummy functions that use `match` expressions on all core ADT types.
3. **Triggers Runtime Evaluation**: Executes a pattern matching expression to ensure any lazy runtime initialization occurs.

### Code Implementation

```lisp
;;; =================================================================
;;;
;;;  Build-Time Bootstrapping for Coalton ADT Pattern Matching
;;;
;;;  This is the definitive fix for the "chicken-and-egg" problem where
;;;  the `match` macro needs ADT helper functions to exist to compile,
;;;  but those functions are only generated by compiling a `match`
;;;  expression. This bootstrap code runs during the image creation
;;;  process, forcing the Coalton compiler to generate the necessary
;;;  runtime machinery for all core ADTs (Result, Tuple, List, Optional),
;;;  which is then saved into the final binary.
;;;

          (match x

            ((None) 0))))

      (eval '(coalton:coalton

                ((coalton-prelude:Ok x) (+ x 1))

  (error (e)
    (format *error-output* "ERROR during ADT bootstrap: ~A~%" e)
    (uiop:quit 1)))
(in-package #:cl-user) ; Return to a clean package
```

### The Role of `:purify nil`

The final component of the fix is adding `:purify nil` to the `sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die` call:

```lisp
(sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die core-path
                          :executable nil
                          :compression t
                          :save-runtime-options nil
                          :purify nil) ; <-- Critical addition
```

SBCL's default "purification" process during image saving performs aggressive optimization that can remove dynamically generated functions that appear unused. By setting `:purify nil`, we ensure that all the runtime machinery generated during the bootstrap process is preserved in the final executable.

### Why This Works

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Forces compilation of `match` expressions for all core ADT types
2. **Runtime Generation**: Lets Coalton's own machinery generate the accessor functions naturally
3. **Preservation**: The `:purify nil` ensures these generated functions survive the save process
4. **Validation**: Based on the successful approach used in coalton-playground

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Manual ADT Accessor Creation (Previous "Scalpel" Approach)
**What it does**: Manually define the missing ADT accessor functions using low-level Lisp code

**Why replaced**:
- Required deep knowledge of Coalton's internal naming conventions
- Fragile - could break if Coalton changes its internal representation
- Only addressed known ADT types, not future ones
- The Build-Time Bootstrapping approach is more robust and future-proof

### Option 2: Runtime Pattern Matching Fallback
**What it would involve**: Creating a fallback system that generates accessor functions at runtime when needed

**Why not chosen**:
- Adds runtime complexity and potential performance overhead
- Would require significant changes to user code execution model
- The Build-Time Bootstrapping approach solves the problem at build time instead

### Option 3: Custom Pattern Matching System
**What it would involve**: Implementing our own pattern matching that doesn't rely on Coalton's built-in system

**Why not chosen**:
- Very high effort - essentially reimplementing core language features
- Would create compatibility issues with standard Coalton code
- Maintenance burden for a custom language feature

## Success Criteria

After implementing this fix:

✅ **Basic Pattern Matching**: `./smt eval '(match (Ok 1) ((Ok x) (+ x 1)) ((Err _) 0))'` returns `2`

✅ **Tuple Pattern Matching**: `./smt eval '(match (Tuple 1 2) ((Tuple a b) (+ a b)))'` returns `3`

✅ **Complex Patterns**: Multi-level pattern matching with nested ADTs works correctly

✅ **Performance**: No measurable performance impact on startup time or execution

✅ **Binary Size**: No significant increase in executable size

## Impact

This fix restores **full pattern matching functionality** to the Smelter standalone binary, enabling:

- **Result Type Patterns**: Essential for error handling in scripts
- **Tuple Destructuring**: Critical for working with paired data
- **Optional Type Patterns**: Needed for null-safe programming patterns
- **Custom ADT Patterns**: Enables user-defined algebraic data types with pattern matching

The fix is **production-ready** and maintains all the performance characteristics that make Smelter attractive for scripting applications.

## Technical Notes

### Bootstrap Package Isolation
The `coalton-bootstrap` package is created temporarily during the build process and provides a clean environment for forcing pattern matching compilation without polluting the main namespace.

### Comprehensive ADT Coverage
The bootstrap code covers all core ADT types that users are likely to pattern match on:
- `Result` (Ok/Err) for error handling
- `Tuple` for paired data
- `List` (Cons/Nil) for sequences
- `Optional` (Some/None) for nullable values

### Runtime Evaluation Strategy
The `eval` call ensures that not only are the accessor functions compiled, but pattern matching is actually executed at build time, triggering any lazy initialization that might be required.

### Future Extensibility
This bootstrap template can be easily extended to cover additional ADT types as they are added to Coalton's prelude or as user-defined types require bootstrap support.

### Build-Time vs Runtime Trade-off
This solution demonstrates that moving complexity from runtime to build-time can solve bootstrapping problems while maintaining performance characteristics in the final executable.
