# Process Adapter Implementation

**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Adapters Now**: 5 of 6 working (was 4 of 6)

## Summary

Successfully implemented a simplified, string-based Process adapter that avoids Coalton compatibility issues while providing essential process execution, shell scripting, and environment variable capabilities.

## Problem

The initial Process adapter implementation hit fundamental Coalton compatibility issues:

1. **List Conversion Problem**: Coalton lists cannot be directly converted to Common Lisp lists without internal functions
2. **Type Namespace Conflicts**: Complex type definitions (ExitCode, ProcessStatus) caused "Integer namespace compilation issue"
3. **Package Nickname Restrictions**: SBCL doesn't allow using "CL" as a local nickname for "COMMON-LISP"
4. **Result Type Order Confusion**: Result type parameters are `(Result error-type success-type)`, not `(Result success-type error-type)`

## Solution: Simplified String-Based Adapter

Instead of fighting Coalton's current limitations, implemented a pragmatic approach:

### Design Decisions

**✅ String-Based Commands**
```coalton
;; Instead of: (List String) -> Result
(declare run (String -> (Result ProcessError ProcessResult)))

;; Usage
(run "echo hello")           ;; Simple and works
(shell "echo a | wc -w")     ;; Shell features available
```

**✅ Simplified Type System**
```coalton
;; Just two types - no complex variants
(define-type ProcessError
  (ProcessFailed String))

(define-type ProcessResult
  (ProcessResult String String Integer))  ;; stdout, stderr, exit-code
```

**✅ Proven FFI Patterns**
- Used `lisp:` prefix for Common Lisp (not `cl:`)
- Direct `lisp` blocks with explicit Coalton return types
- Followed working patterns from FS/HTTP adapters

## API

### Core Execution
```coalton
(run "ls -la")                              ;; Direct command execution
(shell "echo test | tr a-z A-Z")            ;; Shell with pipes/variables
(shell-with-input "cat" "input text")       ;; Command with stdin
(run-with-timeout 5 "slow-command")         ;; Timeout (Unix only)
```

### Environment Variables
```coalton
(get-env "PATH")                   ;; => (Optional String)
(set-env "MY_VAR" "value")         ;; => Unit
```

### Utilities
```coalton
(which "ls")                       ;; Find executable in PATH
(pipe-commands "echo 1 2 3" "wc -w")  ;; Pipe two commands
```

### Result Pattern
```coalton
(match (run "echo hello")
  ((Ok (ProcessResult stdout stderr exit-code))
   (println stdout))
  ((Err (ProcessFailed msg))
   (handle-error msg)))
```

## Implementation Details

### File Structure
- **Location**: `src/adapters/process.lisp`
- **Package**: `:smelter/adapters/process`
- **Lines**: 159 (down from 656 in complex version)
- **Build**: Enabled in `smelter.asd` line 41

### Key Functions Implemented
1. `run` - Execute command string
2. `shell` - Execute through shell (enables pipes, variables)
3. `shell-with-input` - Execute with stdin
4. `get-env`, `set-env` - Environment variable access
5. `which` - Find executable in PATH
6. `pipe-commands` - Simple two-command pipe
7. `run-with-timeout` - Timeout via `timeout` command (Unix)

### Cross-Platform Support
- Unix: Full functionality via `/bin/sh`
- Windows: Shell via `cmd /c` (untested)
- Timeout: Requires GNU `timeout` command (not default on macOS)

## Testing

### Test Suite: `test/test-process-simple.sh`
```
✅ Test 1 - Basic run
✅ Test 2 - Shell with pipe
✅ Test 3 - Shell with input
✅ Test 4 - Get environment variable
✅ Test 5 - Set and get environment variable
✅ Test 6 - Which command
✅ Test 7 - Pipe commands
✅ Test 8 - Exit code success
✅ Test 9 - Exit code failure
⏭️  Test 10 - Timeout (skipped on macOS)
```

**Result**: 9/9 applicable tests passing

### Smoke Tests
- Fixed arithmetic expansion bug in `smoke-test.sh` (`((counter++))` with `set -e`)
- All existing tests still pass (9 pass, 1 pre-existing failure in hello.coal)
- No regressions introduced

## Trade-offs

### ✅ Advantages
- **Working**: Compiles and runs reliably
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and maintain
- **Practical**: Covers 90% of real-world use cases
- **Fast**: Minimal overhead, direct UIOP calls
- **Type-Safe**: Result types force error handling

### ⚠️ Limitations
- **String Arguments**: Must construct command strings (no automatic quoting)
- **No List API**: Cannot pass arguments as `(List String)`
- **Limited Process Management**: No background processes, PIDs, or signals
- **Platform Dependent**: Shell behavior varies between OS
- **Timeout Requires**: GNU timeout command (not built-in on macOS)

## Examples

### Basic Script
```coalton
#!/usr/bin/env smt run

(coalton-toplevel
  (declare main (Unit -> Unit))
  (define (main)
    (match (smelter/adapters/process:run "uname -s")
      ((Ok (smelter/adapters/process:ProcessResult stdout _ _))
       (println stdout))
      ((Err _) (println "Error detecting OS")))))
```

### Environment Variables
```coalton
(progn
  (use-package :smelter/adapters/process)
  (set-env "MY_APP_MODE" "production")
  (match (get-env "MY_APP_MODE")
    ((Some mode) (println mode))
    (None (println "Not set"))))
```

### Shell Pipeline
```coalton
(match (shell "cat data.txt | grep error | wc -l")
  ((Ok (ProcessResult count _ _))
   (println count))
  ((Err _) (println "Pipeline failed")))
```

## Comparison with Original Design

| Feature | Original (Complex) | New (Simplified) |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| Command Arguments | `(List String)` | `String` |
| Type Complexity | 6 types, 9 variants | 2 types, 2 constructors |
| Lines of Code | 656 | 159 |
| Compilation | ❌ Failed (type conflicts) | ✅ Success |
| Functions | 40+ (many unimplemented) | 8 (all working) |
| Status | Disabled | Enabled |

## Impact

### Before
- 4 working adapters (FS, HTTP, JSON-adapter, JSON-stdlib)
- No process execution capabilities
- Process adapter disabled due to compilation errors

### After
- **5 working adapters**
- Type-safe process execution
- Shell scripting support
- Environment variable access
- Command discovery (which)
- Zero regression in existing tests

## Integration

### Enable in User Scripts
```coalton
(progn
  (use-package :smelter/adapters/process)

  ;; Now available:
  (run "command")
  (shell "command | pipeline")
  (get-env "VAR")
  (which "program"))
```

### Package Qualified Names
```coalton
(smelter/adapters/process:run "ls")
(smelter/adapters/process:shell "pwd")
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements (when Coalton evolves)
1. **List-Based Arguments**: `(run (list "ls" "-la"))` when list conversion improves
2. **Background Processes**: When Coalton supports FFI handles/pointers
3. **Process Signals**: SIGTERM, SIGKILL support
4. **Stream Redirection**: File I/O integration
5. **Built-in Timeout**: Platform-independent timeout mechanism

### Near-Term Additions (with current Coalton)
1. **Command Builder**: Helper to safely build command strings with quoting
2. **Common Commands**: Wrappers for `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, etc.
3. **Process Pool**: Managed concurrent execution
4. **Integration Examples**: Real-world use cases in examples/

## Lessons Learned

### Coalton FFI Best Practices
1. ✅ Use `lisp:` prefix for Common Lisp, not `cl:`
2. ✅ Keep types simple - avoid namespace conflicts
3. ✅ Result type order is `(Result error-type success-type)`
4. ✅ String-based APIs more reliable than list conversion
5. ✅ Follow patterns from working adapters (FS, HTTP)

### Process Management Insights
1. ✅ UIOP provides excellent cross-platform abstractions
2. ✅ Shell wrapping enables 90% of use cases simply
3. ✅ Timeout via external command is pragmatic solution
4. ✅ String commands sufficient for scripting tasks

### Development Workflow
1. ✅ Start simple, add complexity only when needed
2. ✅ Working code > perfect design
3. ✅ Test incrementally (basic -> shell -> pipes)
4. ✅ Fix bash test harness issues (`set -e` with `((counter++))`)

## Conclusion

Successfully completed the Process adapter using a simplified, pragmatic approach that prioritizes working functionality over ideal design. The adapter provides essential process execution capabilities while avoiding Coalton's current limitations.

**Key Achievement**: 5 of 6 adapters now working, up from 4 of 6. Only CLI adapter remains.

**Philosophy**: *A simple, working adapter is infinitely more valuable than a perfect, broken one.*

The string-based API may be less elegant than list-based arguments, but it compiles, runs reliably, and covers real-world scripting needs. When Coalton's FFI capabilities evolve, we can migrate to more sophisticated designs.
