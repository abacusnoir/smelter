# Smelter v0.1.7 Session State - Resume Context

## What We Just Accomplished

### 1. Clean Coalton Syntax Support ✅
**Problem**: User's hello.coal script didn't work because `println` and `show` weren't available.

**Solution**: Created `smelter.stdlib.clean` package with user-friendly aliases:
- `println` → wraps `io-println`
- `show` → wraps `show-int` (for Integer)
- Imported into `coalton-user` package at build time

**Files Changed**:
- `src/stdlib/smelter-clean-syntax.lisp` (new)
- `smelter.asd` (added clean syntax module)
- `src/coalton-translator.lisp` (imports clean package)
- `build/create-image.lisp` (imports symbols into coalton-user)
- `src/cli.lisp` (fixed shebang stripping for leading whitespace)

**Test Coverage**:
- `test/test-clean-syntax.sh` (3 tests, all passing)
- Added to `make test` and `make test-all`

### 2. Repository Made Public ✅
- Changed from private to public for release asset downloads
- `/latest/download/` URLs now work without authentication

### 3. Install Script Improvements ✅
- Default install dir: `~/.local/bin` (no sudo needed)
- Handles tarballs: `smt-darwin-arm64.tar.gz`
- Fixed shebang stripping with leading whitespace
- Better PATH setup instructions with shell detection

### 4. Release v0.1.7 ✅
- All platforms built successfully (darwin-x64, darwin-arm64, linux-x64)
- Public downloads working
- Clean syntax fully functional

### 5. Landing Page Updates ✅
**Repository**: `/Users/agam/Projects/SmelterLanding`

**New Focus**: "Run Coalton Without the Setup"
- Changed from "typed shell scripts" to Coalton enablement
- Tagline: "Run Coalton Without the Setup"
- Features: Zero Setup, Share Examples, Scripts That Work
- Example: Fibonacci with "Quick Start" heading
- Links: coalton.app first, then examples/GitHub
- Install URL: `https://github.com/abacusnoir/smelter/releases/latest/download/install.sh`
- Fixed examples link to use `/tree/master/` branch

## Current State

### Working Example
```coalton
#!/usr/bin/env smt run
(declare add (Integer -> Integer -> Integer))
(define (add x y) (+ x y))

(define main
  (println (show (add 2 3))))
```

This now works! Output: `5`

### Test Results
- All 115+ tests passing
- Clean syntax regression tests integrated
- Smoke, eval, JSON, comprehensive, stress, cross-platform all green

### Install Command
```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/abacusnoir/smelter/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

## Key Technical Details

### Clean Syntax Implementation
1. **Aliases defined in** `src/stdlib/smelter-clean-syntax.lisp`:
   ```lisp
   (declare println (String -> Unit))
   (define println io:io-println)

   (declare show (Integer -> String))
   (define (show n) (io:show-int n))
   ```

2. **Imported at build time** in `build/create-image.lisp`:
   ```lisp
   (import '(smelter.stdlib.clean:println
             smelter.stdlib.clean:show)
           :coalton-user)
   ```

3. **Why it works now**:
   - Symbols imported into `coalton-user` package before save-lisp-and-die
   - Available in coalton-toplevel scope at script runtime
   - No runtime `use-package` needed

### Shebang Stripping Fix
**Problem**: Leading whitespace broke shebang detection
```coalton
  #!/usr/bin/env smt run  # This failed before
```

**Fix**: `strip-shebang` now trims leading whitespace:
```lisp
(let* ((trimmed (string-left-trim '(#\Space #\Tab) content))
       (has-shebang (and (>= (length trimmed) 2)
                        (string= (subseq trimmed 0 2) "#!"))))
  ...)
```

## What's Next (User's Intent)

User wants to continue polishing in the smelter repo. Context needed:
- Clean syntax is working and tested
- v0.1.7 is released and public
- Landing page updated to focus on Coalton enablement
- All systems operational

## Resume Prompt for New Session

```
I'm continuing work on Smelter (https://github.com/abacusnoir/smelter), a zero-setup Coalton runner.

We just completed v0.1.7 with:
- Clean Coalton syntax support (`println`, `show` functions working)
- Public repository with working releases
- Install script using ~/.local/bin (no sudo)
- Updated landing page focusing on "Run Coalton Without the Setup"

All 115+ tests passing. Clean syntax regression tests integrated.

The goal: Enable frictionless Coalton usage - bridge from coalton.app playground to local execution without SBCL/Quicklisp setup.

Working directory: /Users/agam/Projects/smelter

Ready to continue polishing. What would you like to work on next?

## Important Context

1. **Primary Goal**: Make Coalton accessible without Lisp environment setup
2. **Target Users**: People trying Coalton, not necessarily Lisp experts
3. **Flow**: Try at coalton.app → copy code → run with smt (no setup)
4. **Not Focused On**: DevOps tooling, production scripts, benchmarks
5. **Focused On**: Coalton enablement, learning, sharing examples
