# Process Adapter Completion - 2025-10-01

## Summary

Successfully completed the Process adapter implementation using a simplified, string-based approach that avoids Coalton compatibility issues. The adapter is now enabled, tested, and fully functional.

**Achievement**: 5 of 6 adapters now working (was 4 of 6)

## Task Completed

Implemented a simplified Process adapter based on user specifications:

### User Request
> "Use the instructions in this message to flesh out our Process adapter, thus completing our planned list of adapters"

The user provided detailed analysis of previous implementation failures and a clear path forward using string-based commands instead of list-based arguments to avoid Coalton list conversion issues.

## Implementation Approach

### Problems Identified
1. **List Conversion Issue**: Coalton lists cannot easily convert to CL lists for `uiop:run-program`
2. **Type Namespace Conflicts**: Complex type definitions caused "Integer namespace compilation issue"
3. **Package Nickname Restriction**: Cannot use `cl:` as nickname for `common-lisp` in SBCL
4. **Result Type Order**: Result is `(Result error-type success-type)`, not the reverse

### Solution Applied
Created simplified adapter with:
- **String-based commands**: `(run "echo hello")` instead of `(run (list "echo" "hello"))`
- **Simple types**: Just `ProcessError` and `ProcessResult`, no complex variants
- **Proven FFI patterns**: Used `lisp:` prefix, followed working FS/HTTP adapter patterns
- **Essential functions only**: 8 core functions covering 90% of use cases

## API Reference

### Core Functions
```coalton
;; Execute command
(run "ls -la") => (Result ProcessError ProcessResult)

;; Shell with pipes/variables
(shell "echo test | wc -w") => (Result ProcessError ProcessResult)

;; Command with stdin
(shell-with-input "cat" "input") => (Result ProcessError ProcessResult)

;; Environment variables
(get-env "PATH") => (Optional String)
(set-env "VAR" "value") => Unit

;; Utilities
(which "ls") => (Optional String)
(pipe-commands "echo 1 2" "wc -w") => (Result ProcessError ProcessResult)
(run-with-timeout 5 "slow-command") => (Result ProcessError ProcessResult)
```

### Usage Example
```coalton
(match (smelter/adapters/process:run "echo hello")
  ((Ok (smelter/adapters/process:ProcessResult stdout _ _))
   (println stdout))
  ((Err (smelter/adapters/process:ProcessFailed msg))
   (println msg)))
```

## Testing Results

### Process Adapter Tests (`test/test-process-simple.sh`)
```
✅ Test 1 - Basic run
✅ Test 2 - Shell with pipe
✅ Test 3 - Shell with input
✅ Test 4 - Get environment variable
✅ Test 5 - Set and get environment variable
✅ Test 6 - Which command
✅ Test 7 - Pipe commands
✅ Test 8 - Exit code success
✅ Test 9 - Exit code failure
⏭️  Test 10 - Timeout (skipped - timeout command not available on macOS)
```

**Result**: 9/9 applicable tests passing

### Smoke Tests
- Fixed test harness bug preventing tests from running
- All existing smoke tests still pass
- No regressions introduced

### Build Verification
```bash
$ make build
✅ Build completed!

$ ./smt --version
Smelter 0.1.0
Coalton 0.8.0
SBCL 2.5.5

$ ./smt eval '(match (smelter/adapters/process:run "echo hello")
              ((Ok (smelter/adapters/process:ProcessResult stdout _ _)) stdout)
              ((Err _) "error"))'
hello
```

## Technical Insights

### Coalton FFI Best Practices Learned
1. ✅ Use `lisp:` as local nickname, not `cl:` (SBCL restriction)
2. ✅ Result type is `(Result error-type success-type)` (not reversed)
3. ✅ String-based APIs more reliable than list conversion
4. ✅ Keep types simple to avoid namespace conflicts
5. ✅ Follow patterns from working adapters

### Process Management Learnings
1. ✅ UIOP provides excellent cross-platform process abstractions
2. ✅ Shell wrapping (`sh -c`) enables pipes, variables, and 90% of use cases
3. ✅ Timeout via external `timeout` command is pragmatic (Unix only)
4. ✅ String commands sufficient for scripting tasks

### Bash Testing Pitfalls
1. ⚠️ `set -e` exits on `((counter++))` when counter starts at 0
2. ✅ Solution: `((counter++)) || true` ensures success
3. ✅ Affects all arithmetic expressions that might evaluate to 0

## Impact

### Before
- 4 working adapters (FS, HTTP, JSON-adapter, JSON-stdlib)
- Process adapter disabled due to compilation errors
- No process execution or shell scripting capabilities

### After
- **5 working adapters** (added Process)
- Type-safe process execution with Result types
- Shell scripting with pipes and variables
- Environment variable access
- Command discovery (which)
- Cross-platform via UIOP

### Adapter Status
| Adapter | Status | Capabilities |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| FS | ✅ Working | File I/O, directories, paths |
| HTTP | ✅ Working | GET, POST, JSON requests |
| JSON (adapter) | ✅ Working | st-json parsing |
| JSON (stdlib) | ✅ Working | yason parsing with Result types |
| **Process** | **✅ Working** | **Command execution, shell, env vars** |
| CLI | ❌ Disabled | Needs investigation |

**Progress**: 83% complete (5 of 6 adapters)

## Trade-offs Made

### ✅ Advantages
- Working and reliable implementation
- Simple, maintainable code (159 lines vs 656)
- Type-safe with Result error handling
- Covers 90% of real-world use cases
- Fast, minimal overhead

### ⚠️ Limitations
- String commands require manual construction (no automatic quoting)
- No list-based API `(run (list "ls" "-la"))`
- Limited process management (no background processes, PIDs, signals)
- Platform-dependent shell behavior
- Timeout requires GNU `timeout` command

### Philosophy
> *A simple, working adapter is infinitely more valuable than a perfect, broken one.*

The string-based API may be less elegant than list-based arguments, but it compiles, runs reliably, and covers real-world needs. When Coalton's FFI evolves, we can migrate to more sophisticated designs.

## Future Enhancements

### When Coalton Evolves
1. List-based argument API when list conversion improves
2. Background processes when FFI supports handles/pointers
3. Process signals (SIGTERM, SIGKILL)
4. Stream redirection with file I/O integration

### Near-Term (Current Coalton)
1. Command builder helpers for safe string construction
2. Common command wrappers (ls, cat, grep)
3. Process pool for concurrent execution
4. Real-world integration examples

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked
1. ✅ Pragmatic approach: simple strings instead of perfect lists
2. ✅ Following proven patterns from working adapters
3. ✅ Incremental testing (basic → shell → pipes)
4. ✅ Comprehensive documentation of trade-offs

### What to Remember
1. ⚠️ Coalton list conversion is problematic - avoid when possible
2. ⚠️ Type namespace conflicts are real - keep types simple
3. ⚠️ SBCL package nickname restrictions (no `cl:` for `common-lisp`)
4. ⚠️ Bash arithmetic with `set -e` needs `|| true`

### Design Philosophy Reinforced
- Start simple, add complexity only when needed
- Working code beats perfect design
- Document limitations honestly
- Pragmatic trade-offs for real-world utility

## Conclusion

Successfully completed the Process adapter using a simplified, pragmatic approach that prioritizes working functionality over ideal design. The adapter provides essential process execution capabilities while avoiding Coalton's current limitations.

**Key Achievement**: Increased working adapter count from 4 to 5 (83% complete). Only CLI adapter remains to reach 100%.

The implementation demonstrates that understanding and working within Coalton's constraints leads to better outcomes than fighting against them. The string-based API is a reasonable trade-off for reliability and simplicity.

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- ✅ Process adapter working
- ✅ Tests passing
- ✅ Documentation complete

### Future
1. **CLI Adapter**: Investigate and fix remaining adapter (would reach 6/6 = 100%)
2. **Integration Examples**: Real-world scripts using process adapter
3. **Command Helpers**: Safe command string construction utilities
4. **Performance**: Measure process execution overhead

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Build
make build

# Test process adapter

              ((Ok (smelter/adapters/process:ProcessResult stdout _ _)) stdout)
              ((Err _) "error"))'
```
