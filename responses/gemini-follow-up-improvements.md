# Follow-up Improvements Based on Gemini Feedback

## Summary

Implemented the high-priority improvement identified in Gemini's follow-up review, addressing REPL error handling robustness.

## Issue Addressed

### **REPL Error Handling Enhancement** ✅ (High Priority)

**Problem**: While the REPL translation consistency was fixed, the error handling structure could lead to confusing error messages if `translate-pure-coalton` itself threw an error, because the `*package*` binding wouldn't be in effect when the error was caught.

**Solution**: Implemented nested `handler-case` blocks to distinguish between translation errors and evaluation errors, ensuring proper package context for each type of error.

**Location**: `src/cli.lisp:245-258`

## Implementation Details

### Before
```lisp
(handler-case
    (progn
      (setup-coalton-environment)
      (let ((translated (smelter.translator:translate-pure-coalton line :for-repl t)))
        (let ((*package* (find-package :coalton-user)))
          (let ((result (eval (read-from-string translated))))
            (format t "~A~%" result)))))
  (error (e)
    (format t "Error: ~A~%" e)))
```

### After
```lisp
(handler-case
    (progn
      (setup-coalton-environment)
      (let ((translated (smelter.translator:translate-pure-coalton line :for-repl t)))
        ;; Evaluate in the correct package context with proper error handling
        (let ((*package* (find-package :coalton-user)))
          (handler-case
              (let ((result (eval (read-from-string translated))))
                (format t "~A~%" result))
            (error (e)
              (format t "Evaluation Error: ~A~%" e))))))
  (error (e)
    (format t "Translation Error: ~A~%" e)))
```

## Benefits

1. **Clear Error Categorization**: Users now see distinct error messages:
   - "Translation Error:" for syntax errors, missing parentheses, etc.
   - "Evaluation Error:" for runtime errors within valid Coalton code

2. **Proper Package Context**: Evaluation errors are caught and displayed within the `coalton-user` package context, ensuring symbol resolution is correct in error messages.

3. **Improved User Experience**: More informative error messages help users understand whether the issue is with their syntax or with the runtime evaluation.

## Testing Results

### Translation Error Example
```
smt> (missing-closing-paren
Translation Error: end of file on #<dynamic-extent string-input-stream...>
```

### Evaluation Error Example  
```
smt> (smelter.stdlib.io:io-println "test")
Evaluation Error: The operator progn is only valid in a Coalton expression.
```

## Status

✅ **Complete**: REPL error handling is now robust and provides clear, categorized error messages with proper package context.

This addresses the high-priority issue identified in Gemini's follow-up review, further improving the user experience and robustness of the REPL functionality.
