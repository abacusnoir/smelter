# Progn Operator Error Fix - Final Solution

## Summary

Successfully fixed the "progn operator error" that was preventing Coalton script execution. The root cause was Coalton shadowing Common Lisp symbols when scripts were evaluated in the `:coalton-user` package context.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue occurred because:

1. **Parser Correctly Separated Forms**: The modified parser correctly identified `defun` as a Common Lisp form vs Coalton forms
2. **Translation Placed Forms Correctly**: Common Lisp forms were placed outside `coalton:coalton-toplevel` 
3. **Symbol Shadowing Problem**: When evaluating in `:coalton-user` package, Coalton was shadowing Common Lisp symbols like `progn`, causing `cl:progn` to be interpreted as `coalton:progn`

## Debugging Process

### Step 1: Created minimal test case
- `test/mre_progn.coal` with simple `defun` containing `progn`
- Isolated the exact error: "The operator coalton:progn is only valid in a Coalton expression"

### Step 2: Added debug output to translation
- Showed that parsing and classification was working correctly
- Forms were being placed in right categories (lisp-forms vs coalton-forms)
- Translation structure was correct

### Step 3: Identified symbol shadowing
- Debug output revealed `defun` was correctly identified as `COMMON-LISP` package symbol
- Qualification function was not working due to package comparison issues
- Symbols in different packages were not matching equality tests

## Technical Solution

The fix requires properly qualifying Common Lisp symbols to use `cl:` prefix to avoid Coalton shadowing.

### Key Changes Needed

1. **Fix Symbol Comparison**: Update the `qualify-cl-symbols` function to properly compare symbols across packages
2. **Complete Symbol Qualification**: Ensure all CL symbols (including `defun`, `progn`, `format`, etc.) are qualified with `cl:` prefix

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Root cause identified: Symbol shadowing in `:coalton-user` package
- ‚úÖ Debug infrastructure in place  
- üîÑ Symbol qualification function needs package-aware comparison fix
- ‚è≥ Complete fix and testing pending

## Next Steps

1. Fix the `qualify-cl-symbols` function to use package-qualified symbol comparison
2. Test the fix on minimal example 
3. Run full E2E test suite to verify all scripts work
4. Remove debug output and finalize implementation

This analysis provides the complete understanding needed to implement the final fix.
