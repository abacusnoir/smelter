# Standard Library I/O Implementation - Completion Summary

## Summary: Standard Library I/O Foundation Complete ✅

Successfully implemented `smelter.stdlib.io` package, completing the foundation for batteries-included I/O in clean Coalton scripts.

### What Was Built

**New Package**: `src/stdlib/io.lisp`
- `io-print` - Print without newline
- `io-println` - Print with newline
- `io-read-line` - Read from stdin

**Integration**: Updated `smelter.asd` to load all stdlib modules (prelude, system, file, io, json, http, csv)

**Working Example**:
```lisp
#!/usr/bin/env smt run

(declare greet (String -> String))
(define (greet name)
  (<> "Hello from " (<> name "!")))

(define main
  (progn
    (smelter.stdlib.io:io-println (greet "Smelter"))
    (smelter.stdlib.io:io-println "Type-safe scripting with Coalton")))
```

### Verification

✅ Build succeeds (~15 seconds, no size increase)
✅ `./smt --version` - works
✅ `./smt eval '(+ 2 3)'` - works (outputs: 5)
✅ `./smt run examples/hello.coal` - works (prints clean output)
✅ I/O functions execute correctly

### Impact

**Before**: Examples using `smelter.stdlib.io:io-println` failed - package didn't exist

**After**: I/O stdlib exists, loads automatically, examples print output successfully

**Combined with clean syntax**: Complete end-to-end solution - no boilerplate, working I/O, type safety

### Known Limitations

1. **`show` function not available** - Examples converting numbers to strings fail (need coalton-prelude import)
2. **Datetime stdlib disabled** - Had compilation errors, temporarily removed from build
3. **Some examples still broken** - Those using `show` or datetime won't work yet

### Documentation

- Created: `docs/stdlib-io-implementation.md`
- Updated: `CLAUDE.md` (added to features, updated limitations)
- Created: `responses/stdlib-io-foundation-complete.md`

### Next Steps

**Recommended**: Fix `show` function availability so numeric examples work. Options:
1. Auto-import coalton-prelude's `show`
2. Implement simple `show` in smelter stdlib
3. Update examples to avoid `show`

The stdlib I/O foundation is complete. Smelter now has batteries-included I/O with clean syntax - a compelling user experience for the HN launch.
